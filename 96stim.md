### Control your microscope with a voice assistant!

## About
- General-purpose lab automation assistant powered by **Amazon Alexa**
- Enables **voice control of scientific equipment and software**
- Integrates with other Alexa devices and features (smart sockets, timers, calendars, etc)

## Preview

*In these demonstrations, Amazon Alexa calls the LabBee custom skill. LabBee is being used to control an Olympus microscope via open-source [Micro-Manager](https://micro-manager.org/) software.*
