## Bolt-on Electrical Stimulation Drive for Inverted Microscopes (2023)
[![Bolt-on Electrical Stimulation Drive for Inverted Microscopes (2023)](../images/projects-96well.png)](/96stim/)

Open-source upgrade of a motorized inverted microscope to a fully automated electrical stimulation screening platform. The design is based on the original version developed at HHMI Janelia Research Campus, with modifications to increase compatibility, reduce setup time, and decrease cost. Detailed description of the hardware is included. All components are either available off-the-shelf or 3D-printed. The cost to assemble the drive is <$2,000.  [More...](/96stim/)

[![PatcherBot: Walk-away Automated Patch-clamp Robot (2014-2017)](../images/projects-patcherbot.png)](/patcherBot/)

Hardware and software that enables fully unattended patch-clamp recording in adherent cells (such as HEK293) as well as brain slices and *in vivo*. This is the first robotic system that has been demonstrated to patch-clamp multiple cells sequentially without human intervention. The underlying technology has been licensed and is being commercialized by [Sensapex](https://www.sensapex.com/products/umc-automated-pressure-control/). [More...](/patcherBot/)
