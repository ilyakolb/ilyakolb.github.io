## About
 - Enables automated patch-clamp recordings in cultured cells, brain slices and *in vivo*
 - Autonomously performs experiments for 3+ hours with no human intervention
 - Uses computer vision and automated pipette cleaning to close the loop

## Demonstration

* Two pipettes independently patch-clamp multiple HEK cells on a glass cover slip sequentially without human intervention. Green light indicates successful whole-cell recording.
