title: "Improved GABA (Î³-aminobutyric acid) Indicators for Synaptic Imaging"
collection: publications
permalink: igaba2_preprint
excerpt: 'iGABASnFR2 is the current (2022) generation of GABA-Sensing Fluorescent Reporters developed at HHMI''s Janelia Research Campus. Other sensor technologies such as SF-iGluSnFR, jGCaMP8, and jRGECO are optimized for excitatory synaptic transmission and action potentials. iGABASnFr complements these technologies with the ability to detect inhibitory synaptic transmission and inhibitory post-synaptic currents. iGABASnFr2 has the best performance among GABA indicators and is completely genetically coded, which is optimal for in vivo use.'
