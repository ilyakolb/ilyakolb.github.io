excerpt: 'The ability to optically image cellular transmembrane voltage at millisecond-timescale resolution can offer unprecedented insight into the function of living brains in behaving animals. The chemigenetic voltage indicator Voltron is bright and photostable, making it a favorable choice for long in vivo imaging of neuronal populations at cellular resolution. Improving the voltage sensitivity of Voltron would allow better detection of spiking and subthreshold voltage signals. We performed site saturation mutagenesis at 40 positions in Voltron and screened for increased Î”F/F0 in response to action potentials (APs) in neurons. Using a fully automated patch-clamp system, we discovered a Voltron variant (Voltron.A122D) that increased the sensitivity to a single AP by 65% compared to Voltron. This variant (named Voltron2) also exhibited approximately 3-fold higher sensitivity in response to sub-threshold membrane potential changes. Voltron2 retained the sub-millisecond kinetics and photostability of its predecessor, with lower baseline fluorescence. Introducing the same A122D substitution to other Ace2 opsin-based voltage sensors similarly increased their sensitivity. We show that Voltron2 enables improved sensitivity voltage imaging in mice, zebrafish and fruit flies. Overall, we have discovered a generalizable mutation that significantly increases the sensitivity of Ace2 rhodopsin-based sensors, improving their voltage reporting capability.'
