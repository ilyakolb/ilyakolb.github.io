I am currently a Scientist at [Arcadia Science](https://www.arcadiascience.com/). Previously, I was a Director High-Throughput Screening at Aromyx, a startup company that used engineered biology to quantify the senses of smell and taste. Prior to that, I co-managed the [GENIE Project](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/genie) at HHMI Janelia Research Campus, where I helped develop best-in-class protein sensors of calcium, membrane voltage and neurotransmitters.

I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech where I developed the [PatcherBot](/patcherBot/), a fully automated patch-clamp robot [that has since been commercialized by Sensapex](https://sensapex.com/products/umc-automated-pressure-control/).

I have also worked on several other [engineering projects](/projects/) related to automation and microscopy.
