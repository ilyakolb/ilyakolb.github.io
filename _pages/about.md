I am currently a Scientist at [Arcadia Science](https://www.arcadiascience.com/). Previously, I was a Director High-Throughput Screening at Aromyx, a startup company that used engineered biology to quantify the senses of smell and taste. Prior to that, I co-managed the [GENIE Project](https://www.janelia.org/project-team/genie) at HHMI Janelia Research Campus, where I helped develop best-in-class protein sensors of calcium, membrane voltage and neurotransmitters.

 I received my PhD in Biomedical Engineering from Georgia Tech. During my PhD, I developed the patcherBot ([video 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD5XvcNHiGo), [video 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqFYfrU-XBE)), a fully automated patch-clamp robot [that has since been commercialized by Sensapex](https://sensapex.com/products/umc-automated-pressure-control/).
